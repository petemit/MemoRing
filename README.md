# MemoRing

Memoring is the final project for Udacity's React Nanodegree, and is a simple flashcards app that allows for creating decks with supplied questions and answers.

## Getting Started

- Install: `yarn install` | `npm install` | `expo install`
- Run: `yarn start` | `npm start` | `expo start`

## Details

This app is constructed with React Native components, and uses Styled Components (in places) for styling.  
This app has only been tested on the Android platform (I do not own a MAC), and has some styling attributes that are incompatible with iOS.
